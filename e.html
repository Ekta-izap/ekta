<h1>what is PHP?</h1>
<p>PHP is a language that has outgrown its name. It was originally conceived as a set
of macros to help coders maintain personal home pages, and its name grew from its
purpose. Since then, PHP’s capabilities have been extended, taking it beyond a set of
utilities to a full-featured programming language, capable of managing huge database-driven
online environments.
As PHP’s capabilities have grown, so too has its popularity. According to NetCraft
(http://www.netcraft.com), PHP was running on more than 1 million hosts in
November 1999. As of September 2001, that figure had already risen to over 6 million
hosts, and by October 2003 PHP was reportedly installed on almost 14 million
hosts. According to SecuritySpace.com, PHP is the most popular Apache module
available, beating mod_ssl, Perl, and FrontPage.</p>
